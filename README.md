# Collections-Analysis-Project

This assignment will help introduce one to the Collections framework in Java. The collections framework is a set of classes/interfaces that implement the common data structures used in computer science; they are arguably the most used elements in Java. The aim of the assignment is for one to gain familiarity with programming in Java as well as experience using the collections framework, how data structures function as well as how to implement them and finally the advantages, disadvantages and best use cases of individual data structures.
The general scenario of the assignment is to implement a staff telephone directory for Newcastle University (see the supplied mock data for an idea of what data is going to be stored).
